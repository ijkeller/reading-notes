- How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?
    - events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system
- When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
    - type, listener
- Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
    - event object is the event listener's action that it's waiting for.  At that point it passes a single argument to the function, a reference to the event object
    - the target is the inner most element that was the target of the event, what was clicked on
- What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?
    - propagation is done from ancestor elements to child element
    - bubbling is done from child elements to ancestor elements
