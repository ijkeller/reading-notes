## Readings: Audio, Video, Images

[Video and Audio Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content)

- Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
    - In the early 2000's html didn't have the capability to support video and audio, instead we used plugin-based technologies like Flash, and Silverlight
    - HTML5 had features added that supported &gt;video&lt; and &gt;audio&lt; elements.
- Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.
    - the src (source) attribute shows a path to the embeded content
    - controls gives the ability to control the video to the user
        - either the browser's own control interface
        - or build you own interface using the appropriate [JavaScript API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement)
- Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?
    - to support older browsers
- Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.
    - <audio> and <video> met in college, fell in love and had a baby.  They named the baby Steve.  Steve had a rough childhood growing up as the only girl in her class with an unambiguously boy name.  But, she suffered through and grew up to be a beautiful woman whose female peers only made on average 80% of her earnings.  The End
