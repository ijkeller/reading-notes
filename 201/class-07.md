Readings: Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

[Domain Modeling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)

- Explain why we need domain modeling.
    - to model real world entities and the relationships between them

[HTML Table Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics)

- Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
    - reduced accessability
- List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <span style="color:#990000">**&lt;table&gt;**</span>
    - Semantic elements clearly define its content
        - &lt;table&gt; - creates a table for data
        - &lt;form&gt; - creates some type of form for the user to input data
        - &lt;article&gt; - is an article


[Introducing Constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#introducing_constructors)

- What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
    - constructors build objects
    - is a function and saves repetitive code in the same way
- How does the term <span style="color:#990000">**this**</span> differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
    - **STILL NEED TO ANSWER**

[Object Prototypes Using A Constructor](https://ui.dev/beginners-guide-to-javascript-prototype)

- Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
    - prototypes are like templates and inheritance would be copying the template to create a new instance

[HTML Table Advanced Features and Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Advanced)

------------------------

## Things I want to know more about
- Does the reduced accessibility caused by tables also hapen with grids?  If no, what's the difference?
