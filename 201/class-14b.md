## 14b - What Google Learned About Teams

[What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

This reading is about building effective teams.  It starts by showing team building in business schools.  These teams had similar backgrounds and shared expriences but unfortunately they didn's result in an effective team.  The second example is a team built for case ccompetition, they came from a variety of backgrounds.  Their main connection is their interest in joining the case competition.

This all reminds me of my time in the Army.  At the beginning of basic training we have our heads shaved and our clothes taken away.  Much of our personal identity and the way we tend to group, is tied up in how we present ourselves.  Without being able to identify each other based on cliques we ended up grouping based on personality and similar senses of humor.  When we were finally able to get our civilian clothes back months later we mercilessly made fun of each other because of how we each dressed.  These people that I had grouped with when I had no social cues to go by became some of the best friends I have ever had and unfortunately if we had had the social cues to go by initially we likely wouldn't have given the others much of a chance to become friends.
