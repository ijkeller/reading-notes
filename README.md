### [Readings Overview](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/4824838/discussion_topics/14848973?module_item_id=66431856) 

In Code 201, there is a lot of reading to cover, especially in the first half of the course. It’s more important to <mark>**focus on concepts**</mark>, and to <mark>**know where to find examples**</mark> in the textbooks, than it is to try to read every word.

In fact, it would be downright counterproductive to try to read and comprehend every word, so don’t even try. **Be strategic** as you go through each chapter:

- The pages that are <mark>**dark brown are the most dense and are the most useful**</mark>. Flip through the chapter until you see those, then take a closer look.
- At the <mark>**end of each chapter there is a summary**</mark>; after a first quick pass through a chapter, read each of the points in the summary. If there is anything you do not understand, go back and read about that topic in more detail.
- The <mark>**best thing to do is to study the code examples**</mark>, line by line, so that you understand what is going on.
- <mark>**Manage your time**</mark>. Make your time with the book productive, and not a chore. This is not intended to be an exercise in “reading it to memorize it.”
- 15-30 minutes is adequate time to skim thorough a chapter; time spent on mastery of specific details from the chapter will vary.
- Keep in mind that <mark>**the ability to read and apply documentation is a core skill for developers**</mark>. There’s always new technologies to learn, and you typically learn them by reading the documentation and then playing around with code samples.
