[6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

- What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
    - greater efficiency
    - engaged collaboration
    - learning from fellow students
    - social skills
    - job interview readiness
    - work environment readiness
- In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
    - greater efficiency, having a second set of eyes on the code keeps me from having to find something small that is stopping my code from running.  It would normall take me some time to find a syntax or small logic error, where in paired program the problem is normally fixed close to immediately.
- How does pair programming work?
    - 2 roles, driver and navigator.  
        - driver is the proggrammer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.  
        - navigator uses their words to guide the driver but does not provide direct input into the computer.
            - navigator thinks big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
